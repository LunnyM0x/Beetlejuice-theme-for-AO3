# Beetlejuice-theme-for-AO3
First time making a CSS skin for Archive of Our Own, be gentle (? I used the AO3 Reversi theme as a base

ğŸª²HOW TO USE ITğŸª²

Since AO3 no longer allows users to make their themes public, you'll have to copy the CSS code and paste it in the "Create Site Skin" section.

Go to AO3 and log in > "My Dashboard" > "Skins" > "Create Site Skin" > Then paste the code in the CSS box and name it as you want.

Hope you like it ğŸ«¶ my user is Alex_ASHX and, as you can imagine, I write and draw Beetlejuice stuff ğŸ‘»
