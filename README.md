# Beetlejuice-theme-for-AO3
First attempt at making a CSS template for AO3, be gentle (? I may modify stuff later

ğŸª²HOW TO USE ITğŸª²

Since AO3 no longer allows users to make their themes public, you'll have to copy the CSS code and paste it in the "Create Site Skin" section.

Go to AO3 and log in > "My Dashboard" > "Skins" > "Create Site Skin" > Then paste the code in the CSS box and name it as you want.

Hope you like it ğŸ«¶ my user is Alex_ASHX and, as you can imagine, I write and draw Beetlejuice stuff ğŸ‘»
